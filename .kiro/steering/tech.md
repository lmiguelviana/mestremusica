# Technology Stack

## Frontend
- **Framework**: React with Next.js for SSR/SSG capabilities and improved SEO
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety and better maintainability
- **State Management**: Redux, Zustand, or React Context for global state
- **Styling**: Component-based design system with reusable UI components

## Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js or NestJS (NestJS recommended for larger scale due to modular architecture)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Architecture**: Modular monolith with clear service boundaries for future microservices migration

## Database
- **Primary Database**: Neon Database (PostgreSQL serverless)
  - Auto-scaling compute and storage
  - Pay-per-use pricing model
  - High availability and reliability

## Third-Party Integrations
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe, PagSeguro, or Mercado Pago
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for media files (videos, audio, PDFs)
- **Email Service**: SendGrid or Mailgun for notifications
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets or services like Pusher for chat functionality

## Development Approach
- Start with modular monolith for faster MVP development
- Design services with clear boundaries for future microservices migration
- Services include: AuthService, UserService, SchedulingService, PaymentService, MediaService, ChatService

## Common Commands
Since the project structure is not yet implemented, specific build/test commands will be defined once the tech stack is set up. Typical commands would include:

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run test         # Run test suite
npm run lint         # Code linting
npm run type-check   # TypeScript type checking

# Database
npm run db:migrate   # Run database migrations
npm run db:seed      # Seed database with initial data
```
